#Question 1
#Differences between Python 2 and Python 3
#1) The print keyword in Python 2 is replaced by the print() function in Python 3
#2) In Python 2 implicit str type is ASCII. But in Python 3 implicit str type is Unicode.
#3) In Python 2, if you write a number without any digits after the decimal point, it rounds your calculation down to the nearest whole number.
# In Python 3, you don't have to worry about the calculation rounding down even if you don't add any digits behind the numbers. ex. 5/2 = 2.5
